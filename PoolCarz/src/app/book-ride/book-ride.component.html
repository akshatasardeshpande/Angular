<!-- I. Display 3 buttons followed by a button(Offer a Ride) when clicked on Show All Rides -->
<!-- II. Store the ride details in an array & render it in a table. The array should contain the following fields:
id-number, offerId - string, name - string, car - string, seatsLeft - number, pickUp - string, destination - string -->
<!-- III. When the user again clicks the "Show All Rides" button, it should hide the four buttons & the table rendered.
This button should act as a toggle button to display & hide alternatively -->
<!-- IV. Create a custom attribute directive called MouseHoverDirective and apply it to the table rows.
When the user hovers the mouse on any row, it should highlight the row in blue color and 
when the mouse pointer is removed from a row, the color should be removed as shown below. -->
